# web-histrion
A reference implementation of a web-based histrion compatible with the Nuchwezi DNA Platform.

It is designed to require no other particular dependence except pointing it at or loading a compatible DNA Persona (resource or file).

The rest of the Nuchwezi DNA Platform is still prorietary and thus closed.
